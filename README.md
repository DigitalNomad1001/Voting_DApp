#### Vote for your favorite Blockchain Speaker


#### Overview
This repository includes the Smart Contract for a simple ballot. It is a decentralized application on the Ethereum platform. Interact with the contract through a simple web page to display the vote counts and vote for candidates through the page. I have deliberately avoided using any dapp frameworks to build this application because the frameworks abstract away lot of the details and you fail to understand the internals of the system. (If you want to get more sophisticated I recommend using the truffle framework.) The application is extremely simple, all it does is initialize a set of contestants, let anyone vote for the candidates and display the total votes received by each candidate. You may compile, deploy and interact with it on the blockchain as you wish. Instead of developing the app against the live blockchain, I recommend using an in- memory blockchain called ganache. Remember always set up your dev environment before you get started.
